Simple Installation Instructions

1)  First, you need root loaded on this machine, type	   
    module load root/6.02.08

    Note: root might be upgraded and versions change
    Best bet is to type
    module load root/6[TAB]
    Do not type [TAB] but instead autocomplete root/6*.**.**

2)  install
    source setup.sh

3)  load environment variable XXUSBDIR
    echo env.sh (from run directory)

4)  Run directory is in MyDaq/run
    cd MyDaq/run

General Installation Instructions
For users with Linux Experience

1)  Copy xxusb_3.22 to some local directory
    I.E. ~/soft
   
    (You can put this anywhere, but for the sake of the instructions
    I will continue assuming this directory.)

2)  Go to ~/soft/xxusb_3.22/src

    make

    make install

Now, xxusb libraries are installed. Next, you need to add 
xxusb and it's libraries to your environment variables.

3)  Using favorite editor, open ~/.bashrc

4)  At bottom, add (USERNAME is your username)
    export XXUSBDIR=/home/USERNAME/soft/xxusb_3.22
 
    Again, if you put the xxusb_3.22 somewhere else, change the path
    appropriately.

5)  Close terminal and open new one.
    (Alternitavely, run source ~/.bashrc)

6)  Load root every time you have a new terminal
    module load root/6.02.08

7)  Take MyDaq (from the tar package) and copy it to directory of choice
   
    Inside DIRECTORY_OF_CHOICE/MyDaq

    make

8)  ./runMyDaq

    A GUI will pop up. There is a text entry field.
    You can enter a name for your run (i.e. run_04_18_15)
    Otherwise, default name (output) will be used.
    
    Note: .root will be appended to the run name.
    	  So, in above examples, the outputs will be 
    	  run_04_18_15.root or output.root
 	
    Click Start.

    Do not exit using X at top. Finish with Stop first.

Enjoy!

TROUBLESHOOTING

1) If you get 

Finding XX_USB devices and opening first one found
Found   XX_USB device
Segmentation fault

		You need to turn on and off the CAMAC crate.

2) If you get 

Finding XX_USB devices and opening first one found


Device not xxusb

... Followed by a Seg Fault

    	     There is something wrong with the permissions to
	     access the usb. 
	     This can be solved by going as some super user
	     and typing
	     
	     udevadm control --reload-rules
	     udevadm trigger

	     Alternatively, contact IT support and explain to them 
	     the USB udev rules are incorrect somehow.

3) If during setup you get something about usb.h not found. You probably dont have libusb-devel
	     sudo yum install libusb*
